This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
## Scenario

You've built a finance calculator to help users undertstand what their monthly repayments will be, with a given loan amount, and duration set by the user.

## Excercises

We don't expect full completion on every one of these excercises, this is primarily to get an idea of your approach. There's some ambiguity within the test, so please don't hesistate to ask us any questions during the excercise too.

### 1: Style the component

We've put an image in the `/assets` folder for inspiration/guidance.
You can use either CSS or SCSS.

### 2: Fix the issue reported by the failing test

Running the tests inside the `api` subfolder using `yarn test` should result in one test failing. You'll need to fix the issue.

### 3: Add interest

The calculator is currently set up to simply divide the total loan amount by the number of months. This task will involve adding a yearly interest of 5%. You'll also need to update the tests.

### 4: What next?

What features would you add to the calculator next? What's missing? What would you do to update the quality of the software?
